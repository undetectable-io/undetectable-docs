In the Groups section, you manage groups of users and cloud profiles.
Groups allow you to create separate subcommands for the convenience of working with cloud profiles.
The groups work as follows:
1. you are creating a group;
2. determine the users who are allowed to the created group;
3. when creating cloud profiles (transferring from local to cloud), define them in the created group;
4. by running the program, the user will see only cloud profiles from the groups in which he is a member.
Users can be given access to multiple groups.
Cloud profiles can be moved between groups.
