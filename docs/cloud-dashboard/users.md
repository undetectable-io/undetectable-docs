**Adding a new user**

You can add users one at a time or in a group. 
Let's look at adding a single user:
1. enter the user's email address;
2. assign a user name;
3. define a role;
4. define a group;
5. send an invitation.

Consider adding a group of users:
1. enter the e-mail addresses of the users (line by line);
2. define the role;
3. set the group;
4. send the invitation.
