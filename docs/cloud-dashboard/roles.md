The Roles section is designed to manage user access. By default, 2 roles are created: administrator and user.

If necessary, you can create your own roles using the permissions list.
For example, you can prohibit or allow the creation of profiles (cloud / local), access to configurations, editing roles and groups.
Created roles can be edited.
