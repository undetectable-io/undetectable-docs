# Proxy manager

To avoid the routine work of creating proxies manually, the browser has a function to import proxy settings – Proxy Manager. Here you can create/delete and edit proxies in mass or single copies.

To create proxies one by one, select a new proxy. The configuration window opens:

For adding multiple proxy settings, we recommend exporting the template (Example.csv) first, filling it in, and then importing it into the browser using the appropriate “Import” button.

The template (Example.csv) looks like this

Also we have developed an accumulative bonus program:

- If you bought more than 50 configurations – your discount is 5% for a purchase of new configurations.
- More than 100 configurations – 10% discount.
- More than 200 configurations – 15% discount.

and ect. The maximum discount of 30% remains with you if you buy more than 500 configurations.

## Using configurations on the Undetectable

On the Undetectable you have a choice of free configurations (the number depends on the plan), and it is also possible to connect the configurations you purchased in the store. With the specified parameters, you can quickly select the desired configuration from the list presented.
