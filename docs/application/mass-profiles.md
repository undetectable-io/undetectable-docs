# Mass creation of profiles

If there is a task to create several profiles with different configurations, you can use the Mass creator:

1. Fill in: Start ID, OS, Browser, select the necessary configurations, tags for further grouping, screen, proxy, language and quantity.
For the most convenient and fast creations of profiles we made some additional functions , which simplify the work and save your time:

- mask, where you can select the params in the name, which will be in each created profile:
