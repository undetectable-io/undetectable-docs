# Changing the tariff

## Choice of tariff

When choosing a tariff, look carefully at all the add-ons it includes. Absolutely every tariff includes an infinite number of profiles. 

There are restrictions only on how many devices you will use the purchased license from.

Starter – $75 per month: 2 users and 20 free configurations.

✔️ Team – $169 per month: 5 users and 30 free configurations.

✔️ Business – $299 per month: 10 users and 50 free configurations.

✔️ Custom. The tariff includes the number of users 10 + for each additional $25. It turns out that 10 users go for $299 (as in the Business tariff) + 1 user for $25 = $324. This tariff can be connected from 11 users and more.

You can also buy the plan for 6 months or 12 months and get a discount. In the first case, it is 15% off the total, in the second – 30%.

## Change and modification of tariff
Each purchased tariff is valid for one month from the date of purchase. Then you can buy another plan or continue to pay for your existing plan by clicking on the “Renew” button.

You can change your license at any time by paying the difference between the tariffs and the days you’ve already used on the tariff you bought. 

If you have purchased a Custom plan, you have the option to add more users.
