# Autosave passwords

## The Accounts in Undetectable

To avoid losing account data (logins and passwords), we have made a separate tab Accounts in every profile you create.


<!-- ![Docusaurus logo](/img/docusaurus.png) -->

In this tab we fill in:

- website address
- login
- password

## Where the data is stored
All of this data is saved not only in the Undetectable system, but also in the browser. Using a particular profile you open the website in your browser, and you are offered a list of saved logins for that profile.

In most cases, manual setting of these parameters is not required.

You can also mass import and export a list of websites with accounts in .tsv format (data is separated by a tabulation symbol).
