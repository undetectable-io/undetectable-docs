In the functions of the browser there are Bookmarks with which you can save the sites you need.

Bookmark This Tab – adds the tab you are currently bookmarking.

Bookmark All Tab – adds all opened browser tabs to your bookmarks.

To avoid losing account data (logins and passwords), we have made a separate tab Accounts in every profile you create.

A saved bookmark can be reopened, deleted, or the name and URL can be changed.
